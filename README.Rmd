# mimosa
<img src="https://github.com/avalcarcel9/mimosa/blob/master/sticker.png" height="192">

`mimosa` is an R package based on the paper: [MIMoSA: An Automated Method for Intermodal Segmentation Analysis of Multiple Sclerosis Brain Lesions](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jon.12506/full) by Valcarcel et al. published in the [Journal of Neuroimaging](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1552-6569). This package creates data structures necessary for training and testing and then allows the user to train a model and then apply the trained model to generate probability maps and predicted lesion segmentations.

## Installation

To install the package from neuroconductor, type:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
source("https://neuroconductor.org/neurocLite.R")
neuro_install("mimosa")
```

To get the latest development version from GitHub:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github('avalcarcel9/mimosa')
```

## Vignette

For a full implementation of the methods with output please see our [vignette](https://github.com/avalcarcel9/mimosa/blob/master/vignettes/mimosa_git.md).

## Functions

Below is a list of the functions and a description of options available to utilize through the `mimosa` package.

### count_stats

This function calculates true positive rate, false positive rate, false negative rate, false positive count, and sensitivity.

Formulas for how these are calculated are provided in the 'Evaluate Performance' section.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
count_stats(gold_standard, 
            predicted_segmentation, 
            k, 
            percent_overlap = NULL, 
            verbose = TRUE)
```

_Arguments_

- `gold_standard` Gold standard segmentation mask of class `nifti`
- `predicted_segmentation` Predicted segmentation mask volume of class `nifti`
- `k` Minimum number of voxels for a segmentation cluster/component
- `percent_overlap` Proportion of gold standard segmentation to be overlapped by predicted
- `verbose` Logical indicating printing diagnostic output

### mimosa_data

This function creates the training vectors from a single MRI study that has FLAIR, T1, T2, and PD volumes. When utilizing the function for training you will also need gold standard binary segmentation mask. The function can create a tissue mask (or the user can supply a brain mask), a binary mask of candidate voxels for lesion segmentation, smoothed volumes, and coupling maps. The user may supply already normalized data if they wish to use an alternative normalization method.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mimosa_data(brain_mask, 
            FLAIR, 
            T1, 
            T2 = NULL, 
            PD = NULL, 
            tissue = FALSE, 
            gold_standard = NULL, 
            normalize = 'no', 
            cand_mask = NULL, 
            slices = NULL, 
            orientation = c("axial", "coronal", "sagittal"), 
            cores = 1, 
            verbose = TRUE)
```

_Arguments_

- `brain_mask` brain or tissue mask of class `nifti`
- `FLAIR` volume of class `nifti`
- `T1` volume of class `nifti`
- `T2` volume of class `nifti`. If not available use `NULL`.
- `PD` volume of class `nifti`. If not available use `NULL`.
- `tissue` is a logical value that determines whether the brain mask is a full brain mask or tissue mask (excludes CSF), should be `FALSE` unless you provide the tissue mask as the brain_mask object
- `gold_standard` gold standard lesion segmentation mask of class `nifti`
- `normalize` by default is 'no' will not  normalize images. To normalize images use inputs 'Z' for z-score normalization slices vector of desired slices to train on, for WhiteStripe use 'WS'
- `cand_mask` is `NULL` to use candidate mask procedure proposed with method or a `nifti` object to be used as the candidate mask
- `slices` vector of desired slices to train on, if `NULL` then train over the entire brain mask
- `orientation` string value telling which orientation the training slices are specified in, can take the values of "axial","coronal", and "sagittal", 
- `cores` 1 numeric indicating the number of cores to be used (no more than 4 is useful for this software implementation)
- `verbose` logical indicating printing diagnostic output

### mimosa_training 

This function trains the MIMoSA model from the data frames produced by `mimosa_data` on all subjects and determines an optimal threshold based on training data.


```{r, eval = FALSE}
mimosa_training(brain_mask, 
                FLAIR, 
                T1, 
                T2 = NULL, 
                PD = NULL, 
                tissue = FALSE, 
                gold_standard, 
                normalize = 'no', 
                slices = NULL, 
                orientation = c("axial", "coronal", "sagittal"), 
                cores = 1, 
                verbose = TRUE, 
                outdir = NULL, 
                optimal_threshold = NULL)
```

_Arguments_

- `brain_mask` vector of full path to brain mask
- `FLAIR` `vector` of full path to FLAIR
- `T1` `vector` of full path to T1
- `T2` `vector` of full path to T2 if available. If not use `NULL`.
- `PD` `vector` of full path to PD if available. If not use `NULL`.
- `tissue` is a logical value that determines whether the brain mask is a full brain mask or tissue mask (excludes CSF), should be `FALSE` unless you provide the tissue mask as the `brain_mask` object
- `gold_standard` vector of full path to gold standard segmentations. Typically manually segmented images.
- `normalize` by default is 'no' will not  normalize images. To normalize images use inputs 'Z' for z-score normalization slices vector of desired slices to train on, for WhiteStripe use 'WS'
- `orientation` if `NULL` then train over the entire brain mask orientation string value telling which orientation the training slices are specified in, can take the values of "axial", "sagittal", or "coronal"
- `cores` numeric indicating the number of cores to be used (no more than 4 is useful for this software implementation)
- `verbose` logical indicating printing diagnostic output
- `outdir` vector of paths/IDs to be pasted to objects that will be saved. `NULL` if objects are not to be saved
- `optimal_threshold = NULL`. To run algorithm provide vector of thresholds

## Pre-Trained Models

The method performs best when trained on data. Since gold standard manual segmentations are not always delineated though through the `mimosa` package we have trained four (4) distinct models for use. These models can be called and are stored under the following names:

- `mimosa_model` trained using FLAIR, T1, T2, and PD imaging modalities
- `mimosa_model_No_PD` trained using FLAIR, T1, and T2 imaging modalities
- `mimosa_model_No_T2` trained using FLAIR, T1, and PD imaging modalities
- `mimosa_model_No_PD_T2` trained using FLAIR and T1 imaging modalities

Users should use the model which matches their imaging sequence. For example, if you only have data collected for FLAIR and T1 modalities then you should use the `mimosa_model_No_PD_No_T2`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mimosa_model
mimosa_model_No_PD
mimosa_model_No_T2
mimosa_model_No_PD_No_T2
```
